## Tech

##### - Web app front end is completely based on angular@1.6 , material design.

 - NO BACKEND API.

## Folder Structure and description

- /assests folder contain libraries that are used.
- /build folder contain all self written css and js files,like reset.css to remove all browser default padding margin , of tags etc.
- node_moudules has all the package.

## How app was made:
    - I made this app with Angular.js 1.6, with all the dependecies like angular.animate, angular.sanitize, routes etc.
    -I pulled some of the dependencies, libraries like material design, jquery etc.
    -Then, I thought about front end design and made that.

### Future Scope
